/* Given three increasingly sorted arrays A, B, C of sizes N1, N2, and N3 respectively, you need to print all common elements in these arrays.

Input:
First line contains a single integer T denoting the total number of test cases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains four lines of input. First line consists of 3 integers N1, N2 and N3, denoting the sizes of arrays A, B, C respectively. The second line contains N1 elements of A array. The third lines contains N2 elements of B array. The fourth lines contains N3 elements of C array.
Output:
For each testcase, print the common elements of array. If not possible then print -1.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N1, N2, N3 <= 107
1 <= Ai, Bi, Ci <= 1018

Sample Input:
1
6 5 8
1 5 10 20 40 80
6 7 20 80 100
3 4 15 20 30 70 80 120
Sample Output:
20 80
